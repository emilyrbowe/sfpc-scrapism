## RamblingRubbisher


Hi! I’m the Rambling Rubbisher, a boring and off-putting web persona that writes reviews about publicly accessible garbage receptacles. I figured that if I’m out in the world collecting data on garbage bins, I might as well stick that data in the Open Street Map. Makes sense. I know I have mapped at least 300 bins, so if anybody knows how I can extract my data from OSM, please drop me a line.
Follow me (now with options):

Here. https://www.patreon.com/ramblingrubbisher - for the first 500 posts and new unsanitized posts.
There. https://mastodon.online/@ramblingrubbisher - new unsanitized posts posted in software freedom.
Every where. https://twitter.com/ramblinrubbishr  - links to patreon because this is where everybody is these days.
No fair. https://www.reddit.com/user/ramblingrubbisher - sanitized posts, fun for the whole family as soon as I get unshadowbanned.
Care bear stare. https://www.pinterest.com/ramblingrubbisher/ - santizied posts because I don’t know what pinterest is or how people use it.
